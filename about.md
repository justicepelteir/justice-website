title: About
---

Boston University graduate with experience in technology research, leading high-performance teams and project groups, in addition to mitigating and mediating conflicts. I am attending the Epicodus software development bootcamp after realizing my desire to become a professional software developer. I enjoy nature photography, bouldering, reading, and writing in my free time. Additionally, as of 2021, I am the youngest volunteer Santa on The Holiday Express in Portland, OR to date. I am excited and motivated to work on projects and technologies with the desire to create a positive impact. Some technologies of interest to me are JavaScript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Django and Web3.
