 *The website you are currently utilizing is the third evolution of my website with a different code base running on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. More info on the current site can be found <a href="https://github.com/justicepelteir/justice-website">here</a>. My original <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> powered site's Github repository (the subject of this post) can be found <a href="https://github.com/justicepelteir/mr-justice-website">here</a>.*

After months of working on the website you are now on it is what I call, production ready. I could have made my life easier by deploying a barebones site, but I wanted my first website to be built from Django. Furthermore, as much as I’ve wanted to rapidly apply to software developer roles, and honestly any position that would get my foot in the door of technology it just felt strange to apply without at least one project. I could have done a completely different project that would have gone much smoother but I wanted my first project to be a portfolio, somewhere I could show off my proudest creations and my own thoughts. You may not be impressed by my website, but I definitely am. Below are a few of the reasons I’m proud of the site you are currently on:

1. Unsatisfied with my project’s initial frontend design I taught myself Bootstrap 4 to make it aesthetically pleasing and representative of who I am, at least for now. 

2. I picked up SQL to understand the numerous database issues I had in the beginning of this Django project, and eventually migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL to get valuable hands-on experience managing an industry standard open source database.

3. Realizing at the end of my deployment preparation that Gunicorn doesn’t support Windows by initiating Heroku CLI’s deployment command and realizing the heartbreaking error it displayed meant I had to find an alternative solution. Unfortunately, as I’ve learned, development on Windows machines often lacks robust documentation and finding a Gunicorn alternative I was comfortable utilizing proved fruitless. Once I asked for advice from experienced developers they recommended I try out Linux or WSL2 if I didn’t have access to Mac OS. Initially, I was intimidated by their suggestions as I only have my personal laptop currently and I was afraid of breaking it. However, after choosing the WSL2 route I quickly realized there was nothing to be afraid of and that I actually enjoy Linux. There were numerous things I had to learn that are unique to WSL2 and Linux before I could confidently deploy but here we are.

4. As excited and proud as I am of fleshing out and following through to the completion of my first ever deployed project, I am by no means satisfied. Through all of this I’ve realized as much as I enjoy the backend, I really enjoy the frontend as well. There’s just something about the artistic side of programming that’s just fulfilling in its own right. With that said, I have now begun digging into the third edition of “Eloquent Javascript” by Marijn Haverbeke with the goal of eventually migrating this website to a frontend framework such as Vue or React. Essentially this site will forever be where I showcase my new skills, whether it be on the site or individual project level, and I’m going to enjoy every second of it.

I could continue on about the lessons I learned on the journey I took to launch a project I’d be proud of, but it’s time I treat myself to a hike, Tacobell, a good book or all of the above and just appreciate this project is finished and I’m proud of it. Besides, those are topics for other articles, and I intend to make writing these posts a habit.

If you are interested in my candidacy as a software developer, web developer or anything of the sort please reach out. I’ll now be actively applying to roles.

Thank you for taking the time to read my first blog post. I hope you enjoyed it.
